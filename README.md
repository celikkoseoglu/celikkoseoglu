I code occasionally. I wouldn't say I'm full stack but I do not have an area of expertise. I just learn and do what is necessary to complete a project. I've worked with FPGAs, Windows Phone, iOS, Android, Playstation 4, Java Microservices, compilers, React, OpenGL, WebGL and [even more](https://celikk.me/celikresume.pdf).

Computers have always been my thing ever since I learnt how to read and write from a keyboard at the age of 5. I do parkour and enjoy meeting friends to do outdoor activities. Feel free to reach out via any of the links below.

PS. I do programming streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/celikkoseoglu). Refer to my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNkfllcUq3AkdeD4Aqp_Z2AIGyyF00_d8) for recordings.
